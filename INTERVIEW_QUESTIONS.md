# Interview Questions - Accounting Services Analyst I

## Technical Questions

**1. Walk us through your AP/AR reconciliation process. How do you handle discrepancies?**

_Example Answer:_

> I start by pulling the general ledger balance and comparing it to the aged trial balance from our accounting system. I review each invoice against payment records to ensure they match in terms of amount, date, and reference number. For discrepancies, I investigate the following: timing differences (items in transit), duplicate entries, data entry errors, or outstanding invoices. I document each discrepancy with supporting evidence, notify the relevant departments (Finance/Vendors), and update records accordingly. I typically complete this monthly and keep a tracking log for follow-ups.

**2. What Excel functions and accounting systems are you proficient with?**

_Example Answer:_

> I'm proficient in VLOOKUP and INDEX-MATCH for data lookups, Pivot Tables for summarizing large datasets, and SUMIF formulas for conditional summations. I'm also experienced with Citrix for secure data access and have worked with JD Edwards and SAP for general ledger management. I've used Power Query to automate data imports from multiple sources, which significantly reduced manual entry errors and saved about 5 hours per month.

**3. Describe your month-end closing experience and approach.**

_Example Answer:_

> Our process spans 5-7 days. On day 1, I cut off all transactions and prepare a transaction report. Days 2-3 involve reconciling GL accounts, reviewing journal entries for accuracy, and accruing any outstanding expenses. Day 4 focuses on ensuring vendor invoices match POs and receiving documents. Days 5-6 include a final reconciliation of all sub-ledgers to the GL, and day 7 is reserved for final reviews before submission to the controller. I maintain a checklist to track completion and identify any bottlenecks early.

**4. Tell us about a time you identified and resolved a cost-saving opportunity.**

_Example Answer:_

> While reconciling vendor statements, I noticed we were paying duplicate invoices from one vendor—three invoices for the same shipment totaling $12,000. I flagged this immediately, worked with the vendor to confirm the duplicate, and processed a credit memo. I also implemented a duplicate invoice check in our monthly reconciliation process by setting up an automated flag in Excel for duplicate reference numbers, preventing future occurrences.

## Behavioral Questions

**5. How do you manage vendor relationships and handle conflicts?**

_Example Answer:_

> I proactively communicate payment schedules to vendors and respond promptly to inquiries. When a conflict arises—like a delayed payment—I take responsibility, explain the reason (system issue, missing documentation), and provide a clear timeline for resolution. I document all communications and follow up until the issue is resolved. Building trust is key, so I'm transparent and consistent.

**6. Give an example of when attention to detail prevented a significant error.**

_Example Answer:_

> I caught a $50,000 invoice that was coded to the wrong cost center due to a data entry error. While reviewing the GL distribution before closing, I noticed the amount was unusual for that department. I traced it back to the original invoice and identified the error, correcting it before financial statements were finalized. This prevented a significant misstatement in departmental expense reporting.

---

**7. How do you prioritize when managing multiple urgent tasks?**

_Example Answer:_

> I assess urgency by deadline and impact. Critical month-end tasks take priority, followed by vendor payment issues that could affect relationships. For routine items, I batch them together to improve efficiency. I communicate expected completion times to stakeholders and ask for clarification if priorities are unclear. I also build buffer time into my schedule to handle unexpected issues without compromising accuracy.

## Scenario Questions

**8. A vendor claims they submitted an invoice we can't find. How do you investigate?**

_Example Answer:_

> I'd start by checking multiple places: our email system for the original invoice, the AP system for any partial entries, and the accounts payable clearing account. I'd ask the vendor for the submission date and method (email, EDI, portal). If still not found, I'd check with the receiving department to confirm goods were received as claimed. Once located (or confirmed missing), I'd ask the vendor to resubmit and expedite processing, or work with them on amended payment terms if there was a genuine miss on our end.

---

**9. You need to deliver an AP report in 2 hours with insufficient time for thorough review. How do you respond?**

_Example Answer:_

> I'd prioritize accuracy over speed. I'd inform the requester that 2 hours doesn't allow for a complete audit, and provide three options: (1) deliver a preliminary report with a disclaimer noting it's unverified, (2) focus on critical items only with a targeted analysis, or (3) request a 4-hour timeline to ensure accuracy. I'd never compromise on data integrity or provide unverified numbers, as errors would cause bigger problems down the line.
